//Tips for group!

You can explicitly code by using a : with the type

For example

let count: number = 1;

This improves compile performance and makes it easier for group mates to understand what a piece of code is as well as reduce potential errors by having magic variables.

Always const and let 'let'er!

For loops exist for a reason, don't repeat code if you don't have to.

Don't use else, makes it harder to change code if you want to edit something and has no performance benefit and can make coding more complex. (else if is fine)

Define variables at the top, makes it easier to read and minimizes errors.

Make sure to add a semi colon at the end, good coder practice.

Keep your files organized (please for the love of god kill me aahahhahahahhah)

Keep type consistant between files.

Build code to do things unassumably (meaning build code to handle anything you throw it that works similarly, not for 1 specific thing unless there's no other way)

If you need help ask a group member.
